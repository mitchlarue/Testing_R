# Testing_R
This is a rudimentary look at some climate data across the US and then WA and OR. 
There really is no analysis of any kind going on here, this is more or less me practicing with R and learning about the various plots and functions. 
The first part of the code is largely taken from here: https://www.kaggle.com/jagelves/continental-us-climate-change-1850-2013.
I was following along with the code to see if I could get everything to work. 
After the second choropleth map, all of the code is mine. This work was completed with Juypter Notebook and uploaded as an R file and ipynb file. The ipynb file is convoluted (apologies for that) but at least shows the plots and tables I made. Feel free to download either and try it out!
